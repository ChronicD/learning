The Waffle board of my ongoing Learning Plan can be found here:

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/ChronicD/learning.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/ChronicD/learning)

The issues of this Git Repo represent the items on the WaffleBoard.

This system is a work in progress: The goal is to attain a high rate of learning outcomes per hour.

Inspired by Time banking i am using time as a currency, each item gets assigned a certain amount of time which upon its creation. Once the task is started the time starts to be spent. Upon using all the time assigned to a task it is placed backk into a ready status waiting to be assigned overtime, so as to be worked on again.

Each task will start with a 5min close study of the learning objectives to build a metric to measure the task against. This may include additional items identified as needed for the understanding of the task.

Each task will be reviewed for 5min when done to compare the learning outcomes with the learning objecticves.

Once task objectives are defined a task list is built with increments of 20 min. 

There is a 10 min pause in the middle of a 2hr task ie after 2x20 min blocks.
