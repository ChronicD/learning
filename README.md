The Waffle board of my ongoing Learning Plan can be found here:

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/ChronicD/learning.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/ChronicD/learning)

The issues of this Git Repo represent the items on the WaffleBoard.

This system is a work in progress: The goal is to attain a high rate of learning outcomes per hour.

Inspired by Time banking i am using time as a currency, each item gets assigned a certain amount of time upon its creation. Once the task is started the time starts to be spent. Upon using all the time assigned to a task it is placed back into a ready status waiting to be assigned overtime, so as to be worked on again.

Overtime:<br>
Overtime is the informed allocation of time to a task.

At the beginning of the study time tasks should be identified and given ready status.

Rules:<br>
Overtime tasks cannot be started until other trasks with ready status have been completed.
New tasks cannot be added to ready status until all overtime tasks are complete.
At the end of the study time if all tasks are not complete then they are carried over to the next.
If all tasks are completed early, then a new ready task list is generated for the scope of the remainder of the time.
If at the end of a task it is not complete then a scope of what is needed to finish ti should be ammended to the task.

Each task will start with a 5min close study of the learning objectives to build a metric to measure the task against. This may include additional items identified as needed for the understanding of the task.

Each task will be reviewed for 5min when done to compare the learning outcomes with the learning objecticves.

Once task objectives are defined a task list is built with increments of 20 min. 
There is a 10 min pause in the middle of a 2hr task ie after 2x20 min blocks.

A 1hr task is done with no break, but it is expected that a 10 min break is then taken before starting another.

The expectation is that many tasks will take longer then the scope of the task. Over time task identification and associated time cost will be fine tuned as a skill.
