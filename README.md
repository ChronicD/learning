The Waffle board of my ongoing Learning Plan can be found here:

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/ChronicD/learning.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/ChronicD/learning)

The issues of this Git Repo represent the items on the WaffleBoard.

Inspired by Time banking i am using time as a currency, each item gets assigned a certain amount of time which upon its creation. Once the task is started the time starts to be spent. Upon using all the time assigned to a task it is placed backk into a ready status waiting to be assigned overtime, so as to be worked on again.

This system is a work in progress and as part of it 

Each task will start with a 5min close study of the learning objectives to build a metric to measure the task against.
